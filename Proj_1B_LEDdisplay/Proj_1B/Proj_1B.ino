**********************************************************/

/*THE SECOND PROGRAM: driving the leds in a slightly different way. 
The display cycles round and round rather than repeating endlessly.


SOME OF THE THINGS ABOUT C THAT IT INTRODUCES:


1.  The char variable:  
A char variable is stored in a location in data memory that holds only 8 bits of data rather 
than 16 used for integer variables.
A "char" variable can hold 2^8 = 256 different values i.e. numbers from 0 to 255.
A "signed char" can hold numbers from -128 to +127 (unsigned is the default option for chars).
  
2.  Binary numbers:  
Numbers are saved in data memory as ones and zeros.  For example 1 is saved as 1, 2 as 10, 
4 as 100, 8 as 1000, 16 as 10000. These will be considered in detail later.

3.  Hex numbers: 
These will also be considered in detail later. 
Note however that the hex number 0x8000 is 1000 0000 0000 0000 in binary.

4.  Some logic:
i.e. the “or” and “and” functions and the shift “<<” or “>>” operators.  
There are plenty of good explanations for these on the web. Only basic details are given here.

5.  The "|" (or) function.    10001010 | 10101000 = 10101010
and the short hand notation " a |= b" which means that 'a' is set equal to 'a | b'. 

6.  The "if-else" statements:
Consider the statements
  
  if (m<=5){PORT_1 |= (PORT_1 << 1); m += 1;}
  else PORT_1 = PORT_1 << 1;
 
 The statements "{PORT_1 |= (PORT_1 << 1); m += 1;}" are only executed if “m” is less than 6 
 otherwise the statement "PORT_1 = PORT_1 << 1" is executed.

7.  The "&" (and) function    11001010 & 10101000 = 10001000
Consider the statement 

  if (PORT_1 & 0x8000) overflow=1;
  
It is used here to test the most significant bit (MSB) of PORT_1.

Note:  the "for-loop" is omitted, instead the value of PORT_1 is tested every time that the 
"while-loop" is executed. After 15 repetitions the least significant bit of Port_1 is reset to 1.


MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT FIRM WARE (FW)


Project subroutine “waitforkeypress()”:
This does just does what it says.  It can be use here in place of the "T0" delay by anyone interested 
in exploring the operation of the logic. 
Repeatedly press any key (AK) to see the display develop in slow time. See Proj_1B1.

Note: "waitforkeypress();" brings program execution to a halt awaiting user input from the keyboard.  
This is not really good practice.  Alternatives will be considered in Proj_2 which deals with 
the watch dog timer.*/



//THE PROGRAM STARTS HERE




#include "Proj_1B_header_file.h"



int main (void){

unsigned int PORT_1=1;    //PORT_1 defines the display and initialises it
char m=1;         //m  is only active for the first 5 cycles of the "while-loop"
char overflow=0;      //overflow is set to 1 when the most left hand leds are illuminated
                
setup_UNO;
while(1){ 
    
    
  I2C_Tx_2_integers(PORT_1, ~PORT_1);       //the ~ symbol inverts the ones and zeros
  Timer_T0_10mS_delay_x_m(6);           //Can be replaced with waitforkeypress();     
  if (m<=5){PORT_1 |= (PORT_1 << 1);m += 1;}   //m += 1; is shorthand for m = m+1;      
  else PORT_1 = PORT_1 << 1;            //once "m" is 6 simply shift the display left       
  if(overflow)PORT_1 |= 1;            //if overflow is 1 execute "PORT_1 |= 1;".
  if (PORT_1 & 0x8000) overflow=1;        //0x8000 = binary 1000000000000000
  else overflow = 0;
  }}                        //if PORT_1 is greater than or equal to 0x8000 
                          //place 1 in its least significant bit
                          //this effectively cycles the display round and round 
    

/*
MORE ON THE LOGIC
Note: a|b and a&b operate on the bits defined by a and b
00001010 | 10101000 = 10101010
11101010 & 10100011 = 10000010   

If  PORT_1 starts of as 00000111  
then the statement PORT_1 = PORT_1 << 1 changes it to 00001110
and the statement PORT_1 |= (PORT_1 << 1)
changes it to  
00000111 | 00001110 which equals 00001111

if PORT_1 = 1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx then "overflow" is set to save LH 1
which will otherwise be lost at the next shift left
and subsequently place it in the most RH location
Note x either 0 or 1; LH left hand, RH right hand
